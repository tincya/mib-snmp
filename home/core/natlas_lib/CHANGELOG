	- Rebranded to natlas
	- Reorganized into framework with dynamically loadable modules
	- Added Python version check
	- Better error info when loading improperly formatted config files
	- Added ACL match criteria for discovery: platform, serial, software
	- FIX: Platform / IOS / Serial sometimes not captured if SNMP was not available but CDP/LLDP had it
	- FIX: SNMP timeout could cause crash

	modules
	- Renamed: config -> newconfig
	- Added: showconfig
	- Added: checkconfig
	- Added: get-mac-table
	- Added: get-arp-table
	- Added: get-hosts
	- Added: tracemac
	- Removed: output_stdout

	API
	- Created the initial natlas API
	- Added: config_generate()
	- Added: config_validate()
	- Added: config_load()
	- Added: snmp_add_credential()
	- Added: set_discover_maxdepth()
	- Added: set_verbose()
	- Added: discover_network()
	- Added: new_node()
	- Added: query_node()
	- Added: write_diagram() 
	- Added: write_catalog() 
	- Added: get_switch_vlans()
	- Added: get_switch_macs()
	- Added: get_discovered_nodes()	
	- Added: get_node_ip()
	- Added: get_arp_table()
	- Added: get_neighbors()

v0.10 - 5/5/2018
	- Ported to Python 3
	- Cleaned up and refactored code
	- Improved discovery
	- Improved discovery console output
	- Fixed VSS chassis detection; now finds correct serial# and platform
	- All output referencing node IP now uses best IP instead of first found
	- Try all known IPs for a node until one works; no longer fails on unreacable IPs (eg, VRFs/ACL blocks/etc)
	- Default depth is now 100
	- Added runtime to stdout
	- Renamed 'graph' to 'diagram'

	- Cisco ACL-style node matching (replaced config subnets/exclude with discover)
	  - Added 'leaf' option to stop discovery beyond a matching node
	  - Added 'include' option to stop discovery at a matching node

	- Config option diagram/node_text replaces the below:
	  - include_svi
	  - include_lo
	  - include_serials

	diagram
	- Changed -f option to -o
	- If a LAG spans multiple devices (eg, Nexus) override expand_lag for that device
	- Output can create multiple files. Ex: -o "file.{svg|png}" will create file.svg and file.png

	getmacs
	- Added as new module

v0.9 -
	graph
	- Fixed bug with allowed VLAN lists not showing correct ranges.
	- Fixed bug where certain SNMP lookups could return empty sets and cause an exception 

v0.8 - 9/21/2015
	- Internal code changes.
	- Trunks show native VLAN (if mismatched then both P and C will be displayed)
	- Trunks show allowed VLANs (if mismatched then both P and C will be displayed) (standard range only)
	- Added support for LLDP
	- Renamed config option "collapse_stackwise" to "expand_stackwise"
	- Renamed config option "collapse_vss" to "expand_vss"

v0.7 - 7/25/2015
	graph
	- Added config option "include_svi" to include SVI info for nodes
	- Added config option "include_lo" to include loopback info for nodes
	- Added config option "include_serials" to include serial numbers in diagram for nodes
	- Added config option "get_stack_members" to include additional stack member info (serials, mac's etc).
		This info is also included in the catalog option, with each stack member being a line item.
	- Added config option "get_vss_members" to include additional VSSS member info.
	- Added config option "collapse_stackwise" and "collapse_vss". When =0 clusters will be expanded.
	- Removed SNMP platform detection and now use CDP. This means a low depth may not get the root platform.

v0.6 - 7/19/2015
	graph
	- Changed from PyDot to PyDot2
	- Fixed bug with CDP neighbors that do not advertise an IP (reported by Kent Coble)
	- Added config file option to change font size for node text
	- Added config file option to change font size for link text
	- Changed internal crawl method
	- Improved platform identification
	- Added IOS version identification

	config
	- Added command line module option to output a default config file

v0.4 - 7/10/2015
	- Improved speed.
	- Cleaned up code base.
	- Made PyNetAddr optional (change USE_NETADDR=1 to USE_NETADDR=0 to disable)

v0.3 - 7/8/2015
	- Added -C option to write a catalog of the discovery to a csv file.
	- Runs for ~1/4 the time.

v0.2 - 7/7/2015

	- Config: Changed "ignore" to "exclude". Now a list of CIDR's instead of specific IP addresses (requested by /u/LiftedKilt)
	- Config: Added "subnets" block.  List of CIDR's of allowed subnets to be crawled. (requeted by /u/1n5aN1aC)
	- Fixed bug related to unnumbered layer 3 interface (reported by /u/chazmosis)
	- Fixed bug related to Nexus host format (reported by /u/endemic)
	- Added OID for Nexus platform (thanks to /u/endemic)

v0.1 - 7/6/2015
